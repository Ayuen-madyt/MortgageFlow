## Development

MortgageFlow is built with modern web technologies and designed for online usage. The application uses a robust backend framework with a scalable architecture to ensure reliability and performance.

> **Disclaimer:** I'm a backend and Blockchain developer by trade üñ•Ô∏èüîí, so while the backend is solid and works like a charm, the frontend might not be as polished as it would be from a dedicated frontend developer. If you‚Äôre a frontend wizard, feel free to make it look like a million bucks! ‚ú®
